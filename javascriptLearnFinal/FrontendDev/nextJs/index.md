Next.js is a popular React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and
static web applications. As a JavaScript programmer, to master Next.js, you
should focus on the following key areas:

---

### **1. Basics of Next.js**

- **What is Next.js?**  
  Understand its features like SSR, Static Site Generation (SSG), Incremental
  Static Regeneration (ISR), and API routes.
- **Folder Structure:**  
  Learn the standard project structure (`pages/`, `public/`, `styles/`, etc.).

- **Pages and Routing:**  
  Learn how file-based routing works in the `pages` directory.

---

### **2. Data Fetching Techniques**

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**  
  Use `getServerSideProps` to fetch data at request time.

- **Static Site Generation (SSG):**  
  Use `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` for pre-rendering pages at build
  time.

- **Client-Side Fetching:**  
  Fetch data using hooks like `useEffect` with libraries like `axios` or
  `fetch`.

- **API Routes:**  
  Create custom APIs in the `pages/api` directory.

---

### **3. Styling**

- **CSS Modules:**  
  Learn how to use scoped CSS with `.module.css` files.

- **Global CSS:**  
  Understand how to use `global.css` and limitations in Next.js.

- **Tailwind CSS / Styled Components / Sass:**  
  Consider integrating advanced styling libraries for faster development.

---

### **4. Advanced Features**

- **Middleware (Edge Functions):**  
  Use middleware to handle authentication, redirects, or data manipulation.

- **Dynamic Routing:**  
  Create dynamic pages using `[id].js`.

- **API Integrations:**  
  Learn how to work with third-party APIs or backend services.

- **Image Optimization:**  
  Use the `next/image` component for automatic image resizing and optimization.

- **Internationalization (i18n):**  
  Add support for multiple languages.

---

### **5. Performance Optimization**

- **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading:**  
  Use dynamic imports and lazy loading to improve performance.

- **Static and Server Rendering:**  
  Choose the best rendering method for your use case.

- **SEO Optimization:**  
  Use the `Head` component for meta tags, titles, and Open Graph tags.

---

### **6. Tools and Libraries**

- **React Query / SWR:**  
  Manage data fetching and caching.

- **TypeScript:**  
  Add TypeScript for type checking and better maintainability.

- **State Management:**  
  Use tools like Redux, Zustand, or Context API for global state.

- **Linting and Formatting:**  
  Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality.

---

### **7. Deployment**

- **Vercel Deployment:**  
  Learn how to deploy Next.js applications to Vercel.

- **Other Hosting Providers:**  
  Deploy on platforms like Netlify, AWS, or custom servers.

---

### **8. Testing**

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Use Jest with React Testing Library.

- **End-to-End Testing:**  
  Use tools like Cypress or Playwright.
